OOP LAB

1. Assignment Submission
	For this lab class, you will have to turn in your work twice, specifically:
		▪ Right after the class: for this deadline, you should include any work you have done within the lab class.
		▪ 10PM three days after the class: for this deadline, you should include the source code of all 
	sections of this lab, into a branch namely “release/lab03” of the valid repository.
	After completing all the exercises in the lab, you have to update the use case diagram and the class diagram 
	of AIMS project.
	Each student is expected to turn in his or her own work and not give or receive unpermitted aid. Otherwise, 
	we would apply extreme methods for measurement to prevent cheating. Please write down answers for all 
	questions into a text file named “answers.txt” and submit it within your repository.
2.Branch your repository
	Day after day, your repository becomes more and more sophisticated, which makes your codes  harder to manage. Luckily, a Git workflow can help you tackle this. A Git workflow is a recipe for how to 
	use Git to control source code in a consistent and productive manner. Release Flow1 is a lightweight but 
	effective Git workflow that helps teams cooperate with a large size and regardless of technical expertise. 
	Refer to the Release-Flow-Guidelines.pdf file for a more detailed guide.
	Applying Release Flow is required from this lab forward.
	However, we would use a modified version of Release Flow for simplicity.
	● We can create as many branches as we need.
	● We name branches with meaningful names. See Table 1-Branching policy. 
3. Passing parameter 
	- Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
	First of all, we recall what is meant by pass by value or pass by reference.
		 Pass by value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied  object is passed to the method. That's why it's called pass by value 
		 Pass by reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method. That's why it's called pass by reference.
	Now, you will practice with the DigitalVideoDisc class to test how JAVA passes parameters. For this 
	exercise, you will need to temporarily add a setter for the attribute title of the DigitalVideoDisc class.
	Create a new class named TestPassingParameter in the current project
		● Check the option for generating the main method in this class like in Figure 2
